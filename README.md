# Scrybe for Writer's Cave

## Bugs can be reported on the repository Issues page or in the support server.

### Hosts

Scrybe currently has three hosts:
- Astra - Primary host
- Cybrix - Testing host, usually buggy
- Epsilon - Development host, will not be used too often

You can see which host Scrybe is currently running on by checking its status: it will say "Running on host {HOST}".

If the bot shows an offline status, the bot is down and will not respond to any commands or events.
