# Scrybe for Writer's Cave

## Bugs can be reported on the repository Issues page or in the support server.

### Hosts

Scrybe currently has two hosts. Astra is the main host (self-host). Cybrix is the secondary host which runs in the cloud. It's primarily used for testing and development purposes.

You can see which host Scrybe is currently running on by checking its status: it will say "Running on {HOST}".

If the bot shows an offline status, the bot is down and will not respond to any commands or events.
